# Office Add-in that that supports Single Sign-on to Office, the Add-in, and Microsoft Graph

The `getAccessTokenAsync` API in Office.js enables users who are signed into Office to get access to an AAD-protected add-in and to Microsoft Graph without needing to sign-in again. This sample is built on ASP.NET and Microsoft Identity Library (MSAL). 

 > Note: The getAccessTokenAsync API is in preview.
